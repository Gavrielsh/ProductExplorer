## üì± Project Overview  
**Product Explorer** is a React Native (CLI) mobile application that allows users to explore products from the open [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com), view product details, and manage a favorites list.  

The project was developed according to the assignment requirements, using React Native CLI, Redux Toolkit, React Navigation, TypeScript, and Jest.  
In addition, several improvements were implemented such as offline caching and a dark/light theme toggle.

## üß© Core Features

### üè† Home Screen
- **Fetch** button to retrieve products from the API.  
- Displays product **image, title, price**, and **favorite toggle**.  
- **Search bar** to filter products locally.  
- **Pull-to-refresh** and automatic fetch on mount.  
- **Action bar** with two buttons: **Fetch** and **Theme toggle (Dark/Light)**.  
- Optimized list using **FlatList** for smooth scrolling and virtualization.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Product Details Screen
- Displays full **image, title, price, and description**.  
- Allows users to **add or remove favorites**.  
- Includes a **fade transition animation** between screens.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites Screen
- Displays all favorited products.  
- Allows users to **remove items** from favorites.  
- Shows an **empty-state message** when there are no favorites.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

| Category | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Framework** | React Native CLI (not Expo) |
| **State Management** | Redux Toolkit + Async Thunks |
| **Persistence** | redux-persist + AsyncStorage (favorites + items) |
| **Navigation** | React Navigation (Bottom Tabs + Native Stack) |
| **Language** | TypeScript |
| **Components** | Functional Components + React Hooks |
| **UI Theme** | Custom Theme with Light/Dark/System modes |
| **Icons** | react-native-vector-icons/Ionicons |
| **Testing** | Jest (unit and integration tests) |
| **Offline Caching** | Products and favorites persisted locally |
| **Animations** | Fade transitions between screens |
| **Linting** | ESLint with unused-imports cleanup |

---

## üöÄ Performance & Optimization
- **Memoization** using `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `React.memo`.  
- **FlatList** optimization (windowSize, batch rendering, removeClippedSubviews).  
- **Redux selectors** to minimize unnecessary re-renders.  
- Cached API results via `redux-persist` to avoid redundant fetches.

---

## üß† Technical Highlights
- **PersistGate Integration** ‚Äì waits for Redux state rehydration before rendering.  
- **ThemeProvider** ‚Äì manages light/dark/system themes dynamically.  
- **Reusable Hooks** ‚Äì `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useTheme`, `useThemeMode`.  
- **Error Handling** ‚Äì shows a visual error banner when API fails.  
- **Responsive Design** ‚Äì consistent spacing, adaptive colors, clean layout.

## üß™ Unit Tests
| Test File | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `productsSlice.test.ts` | Verifies reducer and async thunk (fetchProducts). |
| `navigation.test.tsx` | Tests navigation from Home ‚Üí Product Details. |
| `badge.test.tsx` | Checks that the Favorites tab badge updates correctly. |
